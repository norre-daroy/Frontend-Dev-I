              <strong>Rule of Thirds</strong> refers to a 3 by 3 grid, equally
              shaped blocks on top of an image or layout. The points where the
              grid lines intersect are referred to as eye-catching points.<br /><br />
              The hero image of Vessi website fall into the eye-catching points.
              Moreover, rule of thirds is also evident when viewing the website
              in “medium view”, the person holding the umbrella falls into
              “third” region where the eye is naturally drawn at first glance.

            <p>
              <strong>Contrast</strong> refers to the difference of any design
              element that makes one item of the design as dominant. Contrast is
              a requirement for accessibility but can be used as a design
              principle in general.<br /><br />The hero image of Harvard website
              shows contrast by the choice and manipulation of its colors. Its
              header has a light colored text over a dark overlay image. This
              concept attracts viewers interest and easier for users to make
              sense of the visual.

            <p>
              <strong>Fitt's Law</strong> refers to distance from one element to
              and size of the target. This means that the touch targets should
              be large enough or close enough for users to accurately select
              them. <br /><br />
              Etsy website follows this principle by positioning interactive
              elements for their fresh finds promotion close to each other
              reducing selection time. Moreover, the interactive elements
              enlarges when user hovers over them making it easier to click.
